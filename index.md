## About Me
My background is in both the humanities and tech, and I have strong technical skills as well as writing/soft-skills. 

It is my career goal to become a SOC Analyst, and I am currently pursuing the ISC2 CC and Security+ certifications so I can make it happen. 

I learned the fundamentals of cyber security through Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, and fell in love with the field very quickly.

I am currently looking for work such as Tech Support Analyst, IT Helpdesk, Junior Security Analyst, and any other related jobs.
