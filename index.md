## About Me
My background is in both the humanities and tech, and I have strong technical skills as well as writing/soft-skills. 

All things computer-related are my passion, and my goal is to work as a SOC Analyst, helping to defend organizations from threats.

I've recently obtained the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity certificate, and am scheduled to take the CompTIA Sec+ exam soon.

I learned the fundamentals of cyber security through Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, and fell in love with the field very quickly.

I am currently looking for work such as Tech Support Analyst, IT Helpdesk, Junior Security Analyst, and any other related jobs.

## Interests: 

Security Operations, Network Security, Cloud Security, Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR), & AI Security.
