*The accountant at the company received an email titled "Urgent New Order" from a client late in the afternoon. When he attempted to access the attached invoice, he discovered it contained false order information. Subsequently, the SIEM solution generated an alert regarding downloading a potentially malicious file. Upon initial investigation, it was found that the PPT file might be responsible for this download. Could you please conduct a detailed examination of this file?*

The PPT file's MD5 hash was as follows: `12c1842c3ccafe7408c23ebf292ee3d9`. Using the file hash, I went to VirusTotal to check if the file was malware.
