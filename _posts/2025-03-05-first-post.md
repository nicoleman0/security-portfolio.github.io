### greetings
Hi there. Welcome to my security blog, where I will be uploading my progress on various projects!

I am currenlty working on setting up a honeypot VM, so that I can gather information on new malware being used by threat actors.

I will update this blog every week, with new things that I have learned/been able to accomplish.

I hope to see you here!!!
